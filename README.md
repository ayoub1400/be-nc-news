This project requires connection to two databases in order to run. The environment variables needed to connect to these databases are not included in the repository because .env files often store important information about the database such as passwords, API keys and so on. Exposing these to unauthorized users could allow attackers to access your databases leading to potential data breaches, so instead .env files are used which are excluded via 
.gitignore.

If you are cloning the repository to run it locally, you will need to manually create the environment variable files to successfully create the database connections.
